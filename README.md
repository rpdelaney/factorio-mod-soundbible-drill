# Factorio Drill Sound Effect

Replaces the default sound effect for the repair pack with a better drill sound
effect.

Sound by Mike Koenig, found on
[SoundBible](http://soundbible.com/1074-Drill.html). The sound file has a CC-BY

I adapted the mod configuration from files in [Sonic Screwdriver
mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Sonic_Screw_Driver) by steinio. (MIT license).
